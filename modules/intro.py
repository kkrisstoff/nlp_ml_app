       The New York Times (NYT or NY Times) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City with a worldwide readership.Founded in 1851, the Times has since won 130 Pulitzer Prizes (the most of any newspaper),and has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record". It is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.
       The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded. It has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure after its shares became publicly traded.A. G. Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper's publisher and the company's chairman, respectively—are the fourth and fifth generation of the family to head the paper.
       Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008,the Times has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[15] On Sundays, the Times is supplemented by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review),The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times Magazine,and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.
       The Times stayed with the broadsheet full-page set-up and an eight-column format for several years after most papers switched to six,and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, especially on the front page.The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page.
